# fizzBuzz-1-
This is slightly more difficult version of the famous FizzBuzz problem which sometimes given as a first problem for job interviews. Consider the series of numbers beginning at 'start' and running up to but not including 'end'. So, for example, start = 1 and end = 5 gives the series 1,2,3,4. Return a new String[] array containing the string form of these numbers, except that for multiples of of  3, use 'Fizz', for multiples of 5, use 'Buzz' and for multiples of both 3 and 5, use 'FizzBuzz'.
